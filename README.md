# Vig-nere-Cipher

The code is a Vig√®nere cipher I wrote for Michael McAlpin's Computer Security course in the fall of 2018.
To run the program have the key text file name as the first parameter and the plaintext file name as the second. Then run and watch as your plaintext gets encrypted. 

All input files are examples created by Michael McAlpin. The code is my own.
